##RAPM (Regularized Adjusted Plus Minus)
#####By Daniel Myers [(@DSMok1)](https://twitter.com/DSMok1)

Several years ago I wrote A Review of [Adjusted Plus Minus and Stabilization](http://godismyjudgeok.com/DStats/2011/nba-stats/a-review-of-adjusted-plusminus-and-stabilization/).  Until now, I haven't actually attempted to calculate Regularized Adjusted Plus/Minus myself--while I understood the mathematical underpinnings, I haven't had the programming chops to actually do it.

After my work with [Golf Ratings](https://github.com/DSMok1/Golf_Ratings_R) and a variety of other R projects, I think I can do this now.

The folks at [Basketball Reference](http://basketball-reference.com/) generously provided me with the already-parsed matchup files, saving my the hardest part of the programming.

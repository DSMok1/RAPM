# Pseudocode description of RAPM with priors
# Daniel Myers, 4/22/16

	LOAD csv containing all plays, including lineups on the court, last 15 years
	
	LABELS:
	game_id,date_game,play_id,quarter,time_elapsed_game,time_elapsed_play,player1_id,player2_id,player3_id,play_code,play_type,visitor_team_id,home_team_id,focus_team_id,other_team_id,visitor_lineup,home_lineup,fg_dist,visitor_score,home_score,play_pts

	
### Basic Variables Needed	
	
	ADD Column: possession end (0 or 1) - defensive rebound, turnover, made shot...
	
	IF substitution was made prior to a FT, count the FT as with prior lineup (copy lineup up)
	
	
	
	
### Win Probability (used for garbage time estimation)	
	
	ADD Column: home team win or loss
	PLOT home team win vs. time left and score margin
	MODEL Win Probability for home team as a function of time left and score margin (will be nonlinear)
	PREDICT win probability for all plays in the database and store

### Develop the cleaned matchup file

	CREATE 
		Matchup IDs: 10 man groups in a given season
		Specific Stint IDs: 10 man groups in series
		
	SUMMARIZE csv, collapsing by specific stint
		Score at beginnning
		Score at end
		Score margin at beginning
		Score margin at end
		Possessions home team was on O
		Possessions home team was on D
		Time in game at beginning
		Time in game at end
		Win Probability at beginning
		Win Probability at end
		# Data to include with this summarize
		Home Team
		Away Team
		Players on court
		
	ADD Columns:
		Offensive Rating for stint (if Poss>0)
		Defensive Rating for stint (if Poss>0)
		
### Compile Prior

# Use %Non-Garbage Possessions

	USING Base PbP File w/Win Prob estimates
	
	REMOVE all columns except team, possessions, Win Probability
	
	FILTER for Win Probability between 5% and 95%
	
	SUMMARIZE by team, Season
		Team Possessions
		Count number of unique games played in
	
	UNPACK the 10 players in the lineups - Make 10 rows w/ 1 ID from each row
	
	SUMMARIZE by player ID, Season
		Possessions
		Count number of unique games played in

	MULTIPLY %Poss by TeamGm/PlayerGm if %Poss is greater than 25%
		# This assumes the player was hurt for the other games
	
	STORE this Player ID and %Poss table for later use
